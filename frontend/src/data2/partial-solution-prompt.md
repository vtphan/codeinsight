Use this template to generate 20 partial solutions to solve this problem:

<student_code> - an unfinished Python program that is ultimately correct but incomplete, reflecting the work of a student in CS1 (an introductory course of the CS major) with varying ability (beginner to advanced), after approximately 7 minutes of effort. Solutions should be close to correct but lack one or two critical components (e.g., missing logic for updating the minimum value, incomplete loop range, missing comparison logic, or uninitialized variables) while being capable of completion without changing existing logic. Reflect a range of abilities: beginners may omit more logic, intermediates may include minor correctable errors (e.g., incorrect loop bounds such as starting a loop at index 0 instead of 1, using `range(len(lst)-1)` instead of `range(len(lst))`, or other realistic errors like using `range(1, len(lst)-1)` or hardcoding bounds, missing variable updates, or minor syntax issues like missing colons, incorrect indentation, misspelled keywords (e.g., `if` as `iff`), or incorrect operator usage (e.g., `=` instead of `==`)) in no more than 2–3 solutions with a mix of syntax issues and logical errors to reflect varied intermediate ability, and advanced students may attempt more complete solutions, typically missing only one minor component (e.g., a single comparison or variable update) to reflect their stronger grasp of the problem. Solutions should vary in their incompleteness and approach (e.g., using `for` loops vs. indexing, different variable initialization strategies). Use clear variable names (e.g., `max_val`, `min_val`, `largest`, `smallest`, or `max_num`) to reflect the diversity of CS1 student naming conventions, maintaining clarity and consistency. Comments are optional but, if included, should reflect typical CS1 student practices (e.g., incomplete explanations, overly verbose, or absent) and appear in 3–5 solutions to reflect realistic variability in student commenting habits.
<student_id> - start from 11.
<submission_timestamp> - a unique random timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (e.g., 2025-05-02 13:05:23) within 7 minutes after 1:00 PM Central Time (UTC-5) on the current date (2025-05-02), distributed to simulate realistic submission times. Timestamps should differ by at least one second to avoid exact duplicates.

Here's the template:
# Student ID: <student_id>
# Timestamp: <submission_timestamp>
## Problem Description:
# Write a function `max_difference(lst)` that takes a list of integers and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the list (i.e., the maximum value minus the minimum value). Assume the list has at least one element.
#
## Examples
# - `max_difference([1, 5, 3, 9, 2])` returns `8` (because 9 - 1 = 8).
# - `max_difference([1])` returns `0` (because max = min, so 1 - 1 = 0).
# - `max_difference([0, -2, 4])` returns `6` (because 4 - (-2) = 6).
# - `max_difference([10, 10, 10])` returns `0` (because max = min, so 10 - 10 = 0).
#
## Requirements
# 1. Do not use built-in functions like `min()` or `max()` for finding the extremes.
# 2. Return the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
# 3. Assume the list has at least one element, but students may include partial checks for edge cases (e.g., empty lists), which should not detract from the core logic.

Output as a JSON file. Ensure solutions are partially correct, adhere to the requirements (e.g., no `min()` or `max()`), and vary in their incompleteness (e.g., missing maximum logic, missing minimum logic, incomplete loops, missing comparison logic, uninitialized variables) and approach (e.g., `for` loops vs. indexing).
